## **Sorting Algorithm**

Let us learn what sorting algorithm is and different sorting algorithms.
A sorting algorithm is used to arrange elements of an array/list in a specific order. For example,

Here, we are sorting the array in ascending order.

There are various sorting algorithms that can be used to complete this operation. And, we can use any algorithm based on the requirement.
## **Different Sorting Algorithms**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Count Sort**
- **Radix Sort**
- **Bucket Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- **Shell Sort**

## **Complexity of Sorting Algorithms**
The efficiency of any sorting algorithm is determined by the time complexity and space complexity of the algorithm.

**1. Time Complexity**: Time complexity refers to the time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution with respect to the size of the input. It can be represented in different forms:

- Big-O notation (O)
- Omega notation (Ω)
- Theta notation (θ)

**2. Space Complexity**: Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory used by the algorithm for a complete execution. It includes both the auxiliary memory and the input.

The auxiliary memory is the additional space occupied by the algorithm apart from the input data. Usually, auxiliary memory is considered for calculating the space complexity of an algorithm.

Let's see a complexity analysis of different sorting algorithms.
